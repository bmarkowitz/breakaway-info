# Privacy Policy

Breakaway and its developers take your privacy very seriously, and as a result we do not sell, rent, store, or collect your data. Other than your favorite NHL teams and players, Breakaway requires zero user information to function.

Because Breakaway contacts third-party APIs created and developed by the National Hockey League, the National Hockey League is able to see the network requests made to their servers, which may include information such as IP addresses, browser type, device type, and more. 

This also means you're subject to the National Hockey League's privacy policy, which can be found [here](https://www.nhl.com/info/privacy-policy), as well as that of any other services and websites you encounter within the app.

_**Note: This app is not endorsed by or affiliated with the National Hockey League. Any trademarks used in the app are done so under "fair use" with the sole purpose of identifying the respective entities, and remain the property of their respective owners.**_
