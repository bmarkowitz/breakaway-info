# Known issues

*Last updated: August 26, 2021*

Below is a list of issues and bugs in Breakaway that we are currently aware of. This list isn't meant to be exhaustive, so if you think you're seeing and issue and you're not sure if it matches something on this list, report it anyway. 

#### Breakaway-related (we can probably fix these)
1. When switching back to Breakaway after some time, some team logos may show as the NHL logo or an incorrect logo (color or team).
2. When visiting the page for a team that is inactive / no longer in the NHL (for example: Kansas City Scouts, Colorado Rockies, etc), the screen appears blank.
3. When visiting the page for a team that is inactive and is related to an active team (Hartford Whalers, Atlanta Thrashers -> Carolina Hurricanes, Winnipeg Jets), the current team's stats and logos appear.
4. The standings are currently only showing the 2020-21 season
5. When viewing a team's preseason schedule, if there is a day that should have two games (a double-header), only the first game will be listed.

#### NHL API-related (likely out of our control)
1. Some games, typically older ones, may be missing goals, penalties, shots, or other stats.
