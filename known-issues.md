# Known issues

*Last updated: October 12th, 2021*

Below is a list of issues and bugs in Breakaway that we are currently aware of. This list isn't meant to be exhaustive, so if you think you're seeing an issue and you're not sure if it matches something on this list, report it anyway. 

#### Breakaway-related (we can probably fix these)
1. When switching back to Breakaway after some time, some team logos may show as the NHL logo or an incorrect logo (color or team).
2. When visiting the page for a team that is inactive / no longer in the NHL (for example: Kansas City Scouts, Colorado Rockies, etc), the screen appears blank.
3. When visiting the page for a team that is inactive and is related to an active team (Hartford Whalers, Atlanta Thrashers -> Carolina Hurricanes, Winnipeg Jets), the current team's stats and logos appear.
4. The name of a team or player may be cut off in the Favorites section of the Discover tab.
5. If you are using a different text size other than the default in iOS Settings -> Display -> Text Size, many parts of the app may appear broken or misaligned.
6. Certain parts of the app may not appear correctly (i.e. misaligned, cut off, sized incorrectly, or just weird in general) on iPad.
7. All-Star Games display their scores properly in the Scores tab, but the team logos appear as NHL logos, and tapping the game leads to an error.
8. A game does not show if a team has an empty net. (You can view the game, but within the game itself, the fact that a team has an empty net will not be displayed.)
9. A game preview may not display part or all of a team's name and/or record.
10. A game will not display the type of power play that a team has (for example, 5-on-4 or 5-on-3, etc), just "PP" and the time remaining on it.

#### NHL API-related (likely out of our control)
1. Some games, typically older ones, may be missing goals, penalties, shots, or other stats.
2. Live games might briefly or temporarily display odd, incomplete, or incorrect information.
